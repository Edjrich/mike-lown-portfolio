        <p>I'm an advocate for making inclusive tech in a world of 'disruptive' tech. My holistic approach to design problems cultivates business value through intuitive & impactful user experiences.
        
        I’m a self-driven storyteller, and have followed a love of film & music throughout my career. Pairing my enthusiasm for tech start-up culture & my passion for creative problem-solving led me to the study of UX Design.
        
        Working on two sides of the Atlantic has fed my curiosity & helped me remain adaptable to ever-evolving industries.I’ve always believed in leaving any place in a better state than I found it, letting principles guide decision-making & seeking insight from diverse perspectives. Informed by a background in customer care, empathy is at the heart of my design approach, ensuring accessibility across established and emerging technologies.</p>
